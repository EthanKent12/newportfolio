            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Currently attending Lethbridge College working toward a Computer Information Technology degree, studies include but are not limited to: HTML/CSS, responsive email design, and customer service. I am quite interested in joining your team and feel my technical skill set and attention to detail make me a strong candidate for this position. This, combined with my experience as a Tech Specialist at London Drugs, instilled an uncanny ability to troubleshoot and fix technical issues in record time. The experience, which complements knowledge in HTML/CSS, further bolsters problem-solving skills and hones attention to detailâ€”two strengths that I will bring to the position of HTML Email Developer. Moreover, through my work as a Salesperson at College Pro, I have been able to enhance my communication and collaboration skills further, which will help me function well in a team-oriented environment. I love this opportunity because I enjoy creating high-quality, responsive HTML emails. My experience includes designing emails using table-based layouts and testing via Litmus to ensure my emails work seamlessly across multiple platforms. I'm committed to providing pixel-perfect designs that match the needs of your clients, and I would love to learn from all the talented people at JAM Direct to further hone my skills. I look forward to any opportunity to contribute to your team and am excited about the possibility of growing with your organization as a web developer.</p>
